Here is a histogram of the poisson distribution:

```{r cars, fig.cap="my caption"}
hist(rpois(100,3))
```

The thing below is a table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "I need this to be the third thing that appears. But it comes out first???")
```

The thing below is a bigger table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:6, 1:6], caption = "I need this to be the fourth thing that appears. But it comes out second???")
```

Here is a base graphics plot:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Another caption"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
